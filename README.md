This repository contains the source code for my PhD thesis.

It is structured as follows:
- [1_eeioa](./1_eeioa) contains theorical backgruond on eeioa, and code to download and mainpulate exiobase data, both for temporal evolutions, upstream analysis notably on carbon and minerals
- [2_eeioa](./2_fuzzy) contains an example on how to assess and propagate uncertainties in LCA using Fuzzy Logic, as well as to find the biggest relative contributors in a modeling
- [3_ecodesign](./3_ecodesign/) contains scripts to deploy three cloud architecture benchmarks, and associated notebook for wasted resources and proportionality

If you're looking for the code of Section 4.3 *Assessing the Environmental Footprint of Software Life Cycle*, it is located at [https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/SoftwareLifecycleEnvImpact](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/SoftwareLifecycleEnvImpact).
