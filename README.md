# Thesis

This repository contains the source code for my PhD thesis.

It is structured as follows:

- [1_eeioa](./1_eeioa) contains theorical backgruond on eeioa, and code to download and mainpulate exiobase data, both for temporal evolutions, upstream analysis notably on carbon and minerals
- [2_fuzzy](./2_fuzzy) contains an example on how to assess and propagate uncertainties in LCA using Fuzzy Logic, as well as to find the biggest relative contributors in a modeling
- The bottom-up approach to assess cloud servicesâ€™ environmental impacts is available at [https://github.com/tibosmn/boaviztapi-hotcarbon](https://github.com/tibosmn/boaviztapi-hotcarbon). As part of the work done in the Boavizta's working group, the API as well as future updates are in [https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi](https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi)
- [3_ecodesign](./3_ecodesign/) contains scripts to deploy three cloud architecture benchmarks, and associated notebook for wasted resources and proportionality
