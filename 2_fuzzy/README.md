# Handling uncertainties with Fuzzy Logic

This folder contains the source code to assess and propagate uncertainties using Fuzzy Logic.
To use Jupyter notebook files, create a venv and install requirements as follows:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- [arithmetics.ipynb](./arithmetics.ipynb) contains the logic behing uncertainty propagation in arithmetic operations
- [fuzzy_class.py](./fuzzy_class.py) contains the Fuzzy operations logic
- [fuzzy_uncertainties.ipynb](./fuzzy_uncertainties.ipynb) contains the development of uncertainty analysis using fuzzy logic
